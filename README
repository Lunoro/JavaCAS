Hello from germany, this project is just a little fun project of mine. I was bored in class and thought it would be nice to code a simple program to visualize mathematical functions. Its inspired by the Casio CAS Software of my calculator. Dont take it too serious, I just wanted to try something I've never done.

Code might be ugly ;)
